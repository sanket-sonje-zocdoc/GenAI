globs: 
---
Enhance the readability and maintainability of the following Swift code by adding clear, concise, and professional comments and docstrings. Ensure that:

- Each function includes a Swift-style docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value (if any).
- Complex or non-trivial logic is explained with inline comments.
- Class and struct definitions include a high-level overview of their role and usage.
- The comments follow Appleâ€™s Swift documentation style guidelines and best practices.
- The documentation should not be chatty. Do not over document the code.
