/// Usage:
/// ```
/// Text("Hello")

/// The design system is organized into different categories:
/// - Colors: Defines the app's color palette
/// - Typography (Future): Will define text styles and fonts
/// - Spacing (Future): Will define consistent spacing units
/// - Shadows (Future): Will define elevation and depth styles
